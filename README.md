# Team Members:
Alex Young - Team documentation and data gatherer  
Kevin Hsu - Hosted the VS code, found .Json libraries  
Will Nelson - Developed the React and js code base for visualizing the geolocation data  
Jarod Guerrero - made a a Nav bar and learned a lot about js and react code  
Daniel Yan - Developed React and .js code base for visualization and the color coding for income levels  

# Summary:
Using .Json Libraries from data.gov and kingcounty api's our team created a website that shows income levels by zipcode.
Used multiple .js, CSS, and HTML files to create a website
This website represented data of income across every zipcode in King County
Also worked on correlating college tuition to median income levels in each zipcode in King County

# Conclusion:
The team worked very hard for oveer 12 hours in this rigorous hackathon
There were multiple breaks for different workshops and we all gained a lot of knowledgs and experience working in teams
Only a couple of us knew each other but we were able to collaborate effectively to create a fucntioning and practical website
This Website can be used by students that will help them pick which area to live in based on median income and the related tuition costs
The project came down to the wire but we were able to finish and present to the rest of the Hackathon members
In the future we hope to expand this project to w wider area but the amount of data we were sorting through and trying to find slowed us down immensly.
